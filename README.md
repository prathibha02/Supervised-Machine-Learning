Predicting Credit Risk by Supervised Machine Learning

In this assignment, you will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to 

We will use data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, we will compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

The data is located in the Resources folder.

* `lending_data.csv`

We will create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before we create, fit, and score the models, we make a prediction as to which model we think will perform better. 


We created a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. We did the same for a Random Forest Classifier.  Which model performed better? How does that compare to our prediction?
